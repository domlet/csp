# Express following comparison boolean expressions in Python and print them
# LET PYTHON DO THE CALCULATION(EVALUATION)

# Example: Is 10 greater or equal to  5?
print(10 >= 5)

# 1) Is 10 less than or equal to 5?


# 2) Is 5 less than or equals to 5?


# 3) Is 5 greater than 5.1?


# 4) Is 5 equals 5?


# 5) Is 5 not equals to 10?


# 6) Is 10 mod 2 equals 0?


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rewrite the following "pseudocode" (not true code, outline) in Python
# 7) Assign 5 to x
#   Assign 10 to y
#   Print the result of: is x more than y?


# 8) Assign 4 to x
#   Assign 11 to y
#   Print the result of: is y equals x + 5?


# 9) Assign 5 + 1.2 to x
#   Assign x + 5 to y
#   Print the result of: is x + 10 equals y + 5?


# 10) Assign 3.14 multiply by 9.14 to x
#   Assign 60 divided by 2.1 to y
#   Print the result of: is x less than y?


# 11) Assign 11 to x
#   Print the result of: is x mod 2 not equals to 0?
