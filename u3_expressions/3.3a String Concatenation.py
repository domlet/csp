# Your phone number is 510 123 1234 and you tried to store 3 different parts as integers as below

# area code
areacode = 510
prefix = 123
number = 1234

# You're trying to use the print function to print the phone number as 5101231234 but it's not
# working.
print(areacode+prefix+number)

# 1) What should you do so that the line 10 prints your phone as 5101231234?
# Hint - change 3 variables above (lines 4-6) to string values and Line 10 will print them according to the string concatenation rule


# 2) You decided to make it more readable by printing your phone number as (510) 123-1234
# Add a new print statement below that would print number as (510) 123-1234.
# DO NOT USE F-STRING; USE STRING CONCATENATION
