# In computer programming, the act of swapping two variables refers
# to mutually exchanging the values of the variables.

# Here are two variables with values. DO NOT CHANGE.
X = "red circle"
Y = "blue square"


# Use the swap algorithm to swap these two values
# Your code here


# print out. DO NOT CHANGE
# Let's use string concatenation
print("X now has a " + X + " and Y now has a " + Y + ".")
