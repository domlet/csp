#assign 5, 2, 3 to num1, num2, and num3 respectively
num1 = 
num2 = 
num3 = 


#1. calculate num1 + num2
ans1 = 

#2. calculate num1 * num2 + num3
#Let Python figure out the order of operations
ans2 = 

#3. do the same as #2 but do the addtion first
#Hint: Use () to let Python know which one to do first
ans3 = 

#4. calculate num1 divided by num2 
ans4 = 

#5. multiply ans4 by num1 and assign the value(answer) to ans5 (new variable)


#6. output
#print ans1, ans2, ans3, ans4, and ans5
