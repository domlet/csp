# You have a deck of cards with following cards:
deck = ["♠2","♠3","♠4","♠5","♠6","♠7","♠8","♠9","♠10","♠J","♠Q","♠K","♠A"]

# Create a function called pick_random_card() 
# that randomly picks a card from a deck of cards and prints it. 
# (This means a deck of cards will be passed onto the function as an argument.)  
# For this assignment, YOU DO NOT NEED to remove the card that was picked from the deck.  
# HINT: See 8.3b. Use len() as one of the arguments for random.randint(). 
# Don't assume the deck will always have 13 cards. (DO NOT USE RANDOM.CHOICE.)

# TODO: Define a function called pick_random_card:



# TODO: Call this function 5 times using a for loop:
# (This will print 5 random cards.)
